A fully functional analog spike-based implementation of a memory model bio-inspired by the hippocampus implemented on the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8094868">DYNAP-SE</a> hardware platform using the technology of the Spiking Neuronal Network (SNN) is presented. The code is written in Python and makes use of the Samna library and their adaptation for DYNAP-SE called <a href="https://code.ini.uzh.ch/ncs/libs/dynap-se1">dynap-se1</a>. In addition, the necessary scripts to replicate the tests and plots carried out in the paper are included, together with data and plots of the tests.

<strong>Title</strong>: A bio-inspired hardware implementation of an analog spike-based hippocampus memory model

<p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong>: The need for processing at the edge the increasing amount of data that is being produced by multitudes of sensors has led to the demand for mode power efficient computational systems, by exploring alternative computing paradigms and technologies. Neuromorphic engineering is a promising approach that can address this need by developing electronic systems that faithfully emulate the computational properties of animal brains. In particular, the hippocampus stands out as one of the most relevant brain region for implementing  auto associative memories capable of learning large amounts of information quickly and recalling it efficiently. In this work, we present a computational spike-based memory model inspired by the hippocampus that takes advantage of the features of analog electronic circuits: energy efficiency, compactness, and real-time operation. This model can learn memories, recall them from a partial fragment and forget. It has been implemented as a Spiking Neural Networks directly on a mixed-signal neuromorphic chip. We describe the details of the hardware implementation and demonstrate its operation via a series of benchmark experiments, showing how this research prototype paves the way for the development of future robust and low-power mixed-signal neuromorphic processing systems.</p>

In the event file, the following can be found for each spike generated in the network: the time instant at which it occurred (timestamp_ms), the id of the neuron that generated it at the global level of the network (neuron_ids) as formatted at the local level of the population to which it belongs (neuron_ids_formated) and the tag associated with said neuron (event_tag) formed by the population to which the neuron that produces the spike belongs plus its local id.</li>

<h2 name="Usage">Usage</h2>
<p align="justify">
To run the different experiments, it is necessary to install all the libraries indicated in the <a href="#Instalation">instalation</a> section, to have a local or online tool for running notebooks and to have access to a DYNAPSE1 board. Each cell of each notebook comments to a greater or lesser extent on what is happening in it. In general terms: connecting to the board, declaring the functions to be used during the definition of the network, defining the neural network itself, defining the learning mechanism, configuring the parameters of neurons and synapses per core of the board, elaborating and applying the tests to the model, taking and formatting the results network data and creating the figures with the data taken as a result of the test.
</p>

<p align="justify">
For this code to work, it is necessary to modify the local path to the "ctxctl_contrib" library in the first cell and the path to the STDP triplet mechanism parameter file in the configuration cell of this mechanism. If you want to modify between the different network sizes that have been tested for each model, modify the variable "exp_id" indicating which of all of them you want to test (immediately before the variable it is explained for each number which net size will be used). Finally, if you want to apply different tests on the network, modify the variable "experiment" indicating which of all the tests you want to apply.
